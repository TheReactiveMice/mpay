<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The MPay - It's not a bank or a payment gateway that is managed by the corporation, it's only your bank. Before you'll begin on your own way, you need to understood:
- You can modify code, use it as you want, but should to use an original index.js file, it's disn't disallow modification the plugins and it's configuration (including original config.json file), unless you won't to use ITS, you can modify the code as you want, there is no restrictions, just keep up about the license.
- Be careful before any commits to the code in the main repository, these who use this code, wants to get a secure, and effective economy for a large (or small) project and there is no second chance, you have only one chance.
- If you found an error, just alarm the community about this. Don't care about a sleep of the humans that monitors this repository, it's job on them. Better to find error faster and fix it than it's will damage a lot of stuff. If there is no people to fix the error, try to fix it manually, check it for security (and for more bugs) and send the commit.
- Only you use your account, if your cat, mice and etc logged in the your account and broke up the repo, it's only your fault and you'll banned for a lifetime. We don't care about your pets, family and etc, you should to keep up your's account security, only you and only you be held accountable.
